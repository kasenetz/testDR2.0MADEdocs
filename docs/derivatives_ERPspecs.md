## Derivatives by task

Click [here](https://docs.hbcdstudy.org/latest/instruments/eeg/tasks/) to view descriptions of each task.

`HBCD-MADE.m` computes the following derivatives for each task: 

| Task | Derivatives     |
|------|----------------|
| FACE | SME, Mean amplitude            |
| MMN  | SME, Mean amplitude           |
| VEP  | SME, Mean amplitude, Adaptive mean, Peak latency            |
| RS   | Absolute power (μV²), Power (dB), Natural log power |

- **Mean amplitude**: Mean amplitude (μV) during specified measurement window.

- **Adaptive mean**: Adaptive mean amplitude is calculated by finding the peak during the specified time window and averaging the amplitude across all sampling points within 1 standard deviation of the peak.

- **Peak latency**: Latency (ms) to the peak amplitude during the specified time window.

- **SME**: Standardized Measurement Error (SME) is a universal measure of data quality for ERP data. See [Luck et al., 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/psyp.13793) for more information.

- **Power**: Absolute power (μV²), power (dB), and natural log power for each frequency bin ranging from 1-50Hz.

### Task-based ERP Derivatives

#### Regions of Interest (ROIs)

See below for the ROIs that are used to compute ERPs. The full list of ROIs can also be found on the [GitHub repository for HBCD-MADE](https://github.com/DCAN-Labs/HBCD-MADE/blob/main/proc_settings_HBCD.json).

### Resting State (RS) Power Derivatives

Power values are calculated as follows:

```{r}

Absolute Power (μV²) = (μV²  / Hz)

Log Power  = log10 (1 + (μV²  / Hz))

Power (dB) = 10 × log10 (μV² / Hz)

```

- When interpreting the 50.0 Hz bin in RS output, please be aware that the data are low-pass filtered at 50Hz.
